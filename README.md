## Explanation;

`HTML (index.html)`:

* You have an HTML file that defines the structure of a digital clock web page.
* It includes a viewport meta tag for responsiveness.
* The clock displays a title "Digital Clock," a greeting message, and the time.
* The greeting message changes based on the current time of day.
* The time is divided into hours, minutes, and seconds, each in a separate box with accompanying labels.
* The background of the web page changes depending on the time of day.
* The page also loads external CSS and JavaScript files.

`CSS (styles.css)`:

* You use CSS to style the web page, setting up fonts, colors, and layout.
* Backgrounds are set with gradients or images based on the time of day.
* Styling for the title, greeting, and clock elements is defined.
* A hover effect is applied to enlarge the numbers in the clock.
* The CSS also includes responsive design considerations to ensure the page looks good on different screen sizes.

`JavaScript (script.js)`:

* The JavaScript code determines the current time and sets an appropriate greeting message.
* It defines a function updateTime to update the clock every second.
* The clock displays hours in 12-hour format with AM/PM.
* The setInterval function is used to regularly call updateTime and keep the clock updated in real-time.

This project is a simple yet visually appealing digital clock that changes its background and greeting message based on the time of day. The clock continuously updates to reflect the current time.
